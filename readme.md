# EditTextPlus Widget plugin for TiddlyWiki 5 (TW5)

This plugin brings an `<$edit-text-plus/>` widget that supports common HTML5 attributes not supported by TW5's native widget `<$edit-text/>`.

Supported attributes include:

1. `min`
2. `max`
3. `step`

More attributes *might* be supported in the near term.
